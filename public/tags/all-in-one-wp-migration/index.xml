      <description>&lt;p&gt;Around the time Def Con was happening this year I was sitting at home feeling left out. That made me feel hacky, but I don&amp;rsquo;t get the same joy from CTFs at the moment that I used to. So, I decided to start hunting for CVEs. That lead to finding &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wordfence.com/threat-intel/vulnerabilities/wordpress-plugins/all-in-one-wp-migration/all-in-one-wp-migration-and-backup-786-authenticated-administrator-arbitrary-php-code-injection&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;CVE-2024-9162&lt;/a&gt;, which was just released today, along with the idea for a larger project that has resulted in a few more vulnerabilities yet to be disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
