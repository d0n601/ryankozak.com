### General Thoughts ###
Brianna has been telling me to read this book for years. It was an upbeat little book that had kind of an eastern philosophical essence to it.  

I could quote a lot more passages I enjoyed, but since this book is so very short I don't want to over do it. Here's my favorite.

> "Do you have any idea how many lives we must have gone through before we even got the first idea that there is more to life than eating, or fighting, or power in the FLock? A thousand lives, Jon, ten thousand! And then another hundred lives until we began to learn that there is such a thing as perfection, and another hundred again to get the idea that our purpose for living is to find that perfection and show it forth. The same rule holds for us now, of course: we choose our next world through what we learn in this one. Learn nothing, and the next world is the same as this one, all the same limitations and lead weights to overcome." -Page 44
