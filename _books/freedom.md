### General Thoughts ###  
I saw this book on the end shelves at Barnes & Noble. I wasn't even aware that it had come out. Since I enjoyed Sebastian Junger's [Tribe](/books/tribe/) quite a bit, I decided I'd pick it up and give it a read. Overall I enjoyed it, but it did seem a bit scattered at times.


### Highlighted Quotes ###

Coming soon (I've gotta find all the pages I dog-eared).
