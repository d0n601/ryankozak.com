### Highlighted Quotes ###



After a harsh storm and very slow progress towards their goal, things became very existential. 

>Thought follows thought -- you pick the whole to pieces, and it seems so small -- but high above all towers one form ... *Why did you take this foyage?* ... Can I do otherwise? Can the river arrest its course and run up hill? My plan has come to nothing. That palace of theory which I reared, in pride and self-confidence, high above all silly objections has fallen like a house of cards at the first breath of wind. **Page 124**

>But *no* there is no getting over the evidence of that Siberian drift-wood. **Page 124**

>But if, after all, we are on the wrong track, what then? Only disappointed human hopes, nothing more. And even if we perish, what will it matter in the endless cycle of eternity? **Page 125**

Hansen agreed that it certainly was a life without care. **Page 148**
