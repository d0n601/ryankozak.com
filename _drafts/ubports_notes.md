For some time now, I've expected the introduction of new top level domains to confuse the general public. When user's are confused, they're more easily manipulated, tricket, whatever.

"ICANN will soon begin a global campaign to tell the world about this dramatic change in Internet names and to raise awareness of the opportunities afforded by new gTLDs. Applications for new gTLDs will be accepted from 12 January 2012 to 12 April 2012."

I'd say that in 2018, the nontechnical community still does not understand how domain names work. Even those that are aware that all these additional domain names extensions exist, aren't sure of how they're obtained.


From what I've seen, even semi-technical, people still aren't too familiar with the domain name system. The constant release of new TLD extensions, and how companies choose to adapt to using them, is confusing to users. From a hacker's perspective, anything that's confusing to users is ripe for exploitation.



### Notes and Shit

A list of all valid top-level domains is maintained by the IANA and is updated from time to time.

In 2008, ICANN, the organization that governs these things online, opened an application window allowing many more such domains (called gTLDs) to describe various interests and communities, from .ski to .organic and everything in between.



How can a company register all these extensinos to protect their trademark?  Currently there is one way.
Currently, Deloitte is the only provider authorized to perform trademark verification services for the Trademark Clearinghouse.

The most common TLD used by phishing sites was “.com”, at 49 percent of all phishing sites. (Source: PhishingLabs)

One of the newest mobile phishing threats identified by PhishingLabs is “URL padding”, where phishing scams will create a real-looking URL but take advantage of the limited URL cut-off that often occurs with mobile sites. Users are unable to see the entire URL, making it ehttpsasier for them to fall for fake URLs. (Source: PhishingLabs)
