Hello, I&#8217;m Ryan Kozak and I&#8217;m a security engineer and recovering web developer living in Sacramento. I moved to Northern California in December of 2013, and with the exception of a brief few years living in Memphis, I spent most of my childhood on the Central Coast in a little town called [Santa Maria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Maria,_California) California.

This is my blog, and sometimes I&#8217;ll post CTF writeups, other things related to computer security, privacy, web development, and maybe some rants here and there. This is my home page, so it&#8217;s kind of whatever I want, and I don't want it to be too formal. If you&#8217;d like to talk please check out my [contact page](https://ryankozak.com/contact/), I've got a few email addresses on there.

### More...

I&#8217;m an avid Linux user and an advocate for FOSS. Currently I work as a security engineer in the threat and vulnerability management space, primarily in threat detection automation. In times past I've worked as a full stack developer, mostly using PHP and frameworks like Laravel, CodeIgniter, and the dreaded WordPress CMS. I don't touch most of those anymore (unless they appear in a CTF), with the exception of Laravel, which I still enjoy using for some personal projects like [MapMoto](https://mapmoto.com).

As of 2021 I'm co-leading the <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Sacramento">OWASP Sacramento chapter</a>, which has been a very rewarding/challenging experience.

When I&#8217;m not on a screen I love riding my motorcycles (Motocross and ADV), cooking, traveling, or getting out into the mountains locally. I'm always trying to remind myself that computers aren&#8217;t actually real, and that there's a whole life out side of screens. That is why you won't find me blogging about things that aren't too computer related, it ties everything together too much to post everything I do.
