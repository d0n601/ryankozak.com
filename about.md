Hello, I&#8217;m Ryan Kozak and I&#8217;m a former full stack developer turned cyber security engineer living in Sacramento. I moved to Northern California in December of 2013, and with the exception of a brief few years living in Memphis, I spent most of my childhood on the Central Coast in a little town called [Santa Maria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Maria,_California) California.

This is my blog, and sometimes I&#8217;ll post CTF writeups, other things related to computer security, privacy, web development, and maybe some rants here and there. This is my home page, so it&#8217;s kind of whatever I want, and I don't want it to be too formal. If you&#8217;d like to talk please check out my [contact page](https://ryankozak.com/contact/), I've got a few email addresses on there.

### More...

I&#8217;m an avid Linux user and I primarily try and stick to using open source tools whenever I can (in my personal life). As of right now I work a lot with Python and [Tenable](https://www.tenable.com/) doing threat and vulnerability management automation.

Over the years I've worked alot with PHP and frameworks like Laravel, CodeIgniter, and the dreaded WordPress CMS. I don't touch most of those anymore, with the exception of Laravel, which I still enjoy using for some personal projects like [MapMoto](https://mapmoto.com).

As a former web dev I've really become an enthusiast for the security aspects of web development. I am a member of <a href="https://www.owasp.org" target="_blank">OWASP</a>, and since the <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Sacramento">Sacramento chapter</a> has been revived, I try and make it to those meetups whenever I can.

When I&#8217;m not on a screen I love riding my motorcycles (Motocross and ADV), cooking, traveling, or getting out into the mountains locally. I'm always trying to remind myself that computers aren&#8217;t actually real, and that there's a whole life out side of screens. That is why you won't find me blogging about things that aren't too computer related, it ties everything together too much to post everything I do. I don't like social media at all, I think it's generally aweful for people and society. I do have some profiles though, those you can find on my [contact](/contact) page.
