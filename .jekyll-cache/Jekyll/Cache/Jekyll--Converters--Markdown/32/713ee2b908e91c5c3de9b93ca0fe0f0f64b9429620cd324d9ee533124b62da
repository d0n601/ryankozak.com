<p>I enjoy certain paranormal things for mindless entertainment, see <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/17937-ghost-adventures">Ghost Adventures</a>. Seriously if youâ€™ve never watched that show you should because that guy is hilarious. This book, however, is something I legitimately read with an open mind. It was particularly interesting in light of the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52457805">UFO video</a> that the U.S. Navy declassified.</p>
