<p>I found this story rather emotionally conflicting. It seemed to be inspirational despite the fact that the circumstances it describes are rather depressing overall. This story really highlights the need within individuals to contribute to their society, both Dr. Murray and Dr. Minor exhibit this trait in different ways. James Murray was already extremely gifted and accomplished before he began work on the dictionary. Despite this, he accepted the job as its editor, and continually pushed himself. He felt the need to do more in life simply because he knew he was capable, there for he felt an instinctive obligation. Dr. Minor was left with almost no other way of contributing so significantly to the world, but by taking the opportunity he was given, and immersing himself in it entirely, he was given some sense of satisfaction.</p>
