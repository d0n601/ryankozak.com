I"ö<p>Although Iâ€™ve not actually been inside yet, Iâ€™m on the email list for <a title="Sacramento Hacker Lab" href="http://hackerlab.org" target="_blank">Sacramentoâ€™s Hacker lab</a>. A few weeks ago they put out an email alerting local developers that their new location in Rocklin is hosting an event for <a title="Intel RealSense " href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/realsense-overview.html" target="_blank">Intelâ€™s Realsense 3D camera technology</a>. Itâ€™s not really my field, but I love leaning new things, and I love me a good conference, so I applied. A few weeks later I got called up by an event organizer and they were nice enough to grant me a spot.</p>

<p>Follow upÂ  to come.</p>

<h2 id="update">UPDATE</h2>

<p>The event was very fun, and I cant thank them enough for the food and the presentation, oh and the camera ðŸ™‚</p>

<p>I was really impressed with the technology but a bit bummed that I needed Windows 8.1, and a bit bummed the Java Script support is the least developed. The folks who knew the Unity Engine seemed to be really going to town.</p>
