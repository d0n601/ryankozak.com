<p>Hello, Iâ€™m Ryan Kozak and Iâ€™m a former full stack developer turned cyber security engineer living in Sacramento. I moved to Northern California in December of 2013, and with the exception of a brief few years living in Memphis, I spent most of my childhood on the Central Coast in a little town called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Maria,_California">Santa Maria</a> California.</p>

<p>This is my blog, and sometimes Iâ€™ll post CTF writeups, other things related to computer security, privacy, web development, and maybe some rants here and there. This is my home page, so itâ€™s kind of whatever I want, and I donâ€™t want it to be too formal. If youâ€™d like to talk please check out my <a href="https://ryankozak.com/contact/">contact page</a>, Iâ€™ve got a few email addresses on there.</p>

<h3 id="more">Moreâ€¦</h3>

<p>Iâ€™m an avid Linux user and I primarily try and stick to using open source tools whenever I can (in my personal life). As of right now I work a lot with Python and <a href="https://www.tenable.com/">Tenable</a> doing threat and vulnerability management automation.</p>

<p>Over the years Iâ€™ve worked alot with PHP and frameworks like Laravel, CodeIgniter, and the dreaded WordPress CMS. I donâ€™t touch most of those anymore, with the exception of Laravel, which I still enjoy using for some personal projects like <a href="https://mapmoto.com">MapMoto</a>.</p>

<p>As a former web dev Iâ€™ve really become an enthusiast for the security aspects of web development. I am a member of <a href="https://www.owasp.org" target="_blank">OWASP</a>, and since the <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Sacramento">Sacramento chapter</a> has been revived, I try and make it to those meetups whenever I can.</p>

<p>When Iâ€™m not on a screen I love riding my motorcycles (Motocross and ADV), cooking, traveling, or getting out into the mountains locally. Iâ€™m always trying to remind myself that computers arenâ€™t actually real, and that thereâ€™s a whole life out side of screens. That is why you wonâ€™t find me blogging about things that arenâ€™t too computer related, it ties everything together too much to post everything I do. I donâ€™t like social media at all, I think itâ€™s generally aweful for people and society. I do have some profiles though, those you can find on my <a href="/contact">contact</a> page.</p>
