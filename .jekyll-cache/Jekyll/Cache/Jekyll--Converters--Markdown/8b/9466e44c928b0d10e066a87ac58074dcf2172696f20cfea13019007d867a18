I"T-<p><strong>Update April 10th, 2017:</strong> The plugin developer contacted me about this post. Out of respect for the way they handled it (extremely classy),¬† I wanted to put a link to the paid version of their plugin. So, if you actually want support on the unlimited feed, and don‚Äôt want to do any hacky tricks, go support their hard work via the link below.</p>

<p><strong>Original Article</strong></p>

<p>I came across this info somewhat by accident today while working on an XML Feed generator for a <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/" target="_blank">WooCommerce</a> installation. I‚Äôll often review the code of a couple plugins with similar functions to what I‚Äôm developing. While looking through <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-product-feed-manager/" target="_blank">Woocommerce Google Feed Manager</a> I guess I found a gremlin.</p>

<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/NY-Gremlin.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-380" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/NY-Gremlin-150x150.jpg" alt="NY-Gremlin" width="150" height="150" /></a></p>

<h2 id="tldr">tl;dr</h2>

<p>I‚Äôll put this right at the top in case this is all you came for. To remove the 100 product limit from the free installation of <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-product-feed-manager/" target="_blank">Woocommerce Google Feed Manager</a> , <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-product-feed-manager/" target="_blank">download</a> and unzip the plugin.</p>

<p>Navigate to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/wp-product-feed-manager/includes/application/class-feed-processor.php</code></p>

<p>As of writing this the plugin is in version 1.1.0, and for this version the line your looking for is line:114</p>

<div class="language-php highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span> <span class="nf">get_option</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="s1">'wppfm_lic_status'</span> <span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">!==</span> <span class="s1">'valid'</span> <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="nv">$this</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="n">_product_counter</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="nv">$grmln</span> <span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="k">break</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You‚Äôll want to change this if statement to not break the loop, so just remove the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">break;</code> (pirate comment‚Äôs are optional)</p>

<div class="language-php highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span> <span class="nf">get_option</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="s1">'wppfm_lic_status'</span> <span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">!==</span> <span class="s1">'valid'</span> <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="nv">$this</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="n">_product_counter</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="nv">$grmln</span> <span class="p">){</span><span class="cm">/*Avast, mateys!*/</span> <span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Save the file, re-zip your plugin, and upload it to your WordPress installation.</p>

<p>If you have over 100 products in your WooCommerce Store then go ahead and generate your Product Feed once more,</p>

<h2 id="the-long-winded-explanation">The Long Winded Explanation‚Ä¶</h2>

<p>If you want to know what the above steps actually do, then this will go into a little more detail. I say a little because I really didn‚Äôt go through the plugin very much, I made this discovery, took a couple of screen shots and then moved on ‚Ä¶ I was busy doing real work stuff üôÅ</p>

<p>Initially, I just wanted to see how the application structure looked, and how the feed was being generated. I looked at the file structure and opened <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/includes/application/class-feed-processor.php</code> without looking at anything else first. I noticed the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$grmln</code>¬† variable declaration which lead immediately to the discovery of the if statement mentioned above.</p>

<p>But lets walk through this like we‚Äôre trying to hack the plugin, rather than miraculously discovering a variable.</p>

<p>First, take a look at the main plugin file <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wp-product-feed-manager.php</code></p>

<p>and scroll to line: 115 where there‚Äôs a method <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">define_constants()</code></p>

<p>It‚Äôs not uncommon that constants are all that‚Äôs holding back paid features in free versions of plugins. Definitely far from always, but not uncommonly the case.</p>

<p>Anyway, in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">define_constants()</code> method we see starting at line:160</p>

<div class="language-php highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">// Store the end file lmtr  </span>
<span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span> <span class="o">!</span><span class="nb">defined</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="s1">'WPPFM_FEED_P_LMTR'</span> <span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>  
    <span class="nb">define</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="s1">'WPPFM_FEED_P_LMTR'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">18</span> <span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This sparks interest in those who‚Äôd be seeking to perhaps‚Ä¶.change the limit of the feed.¬† So let‚Äôs see where this <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WPPFM_FEED_P_LMTR</code> is called.<figure id="attachment_368" style="max-width: 652px" class="wp-caption alignnone"></figure></p>

<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Screenshot-from-2016-08-11-151947.png"><img class="wp-image-368 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Screenshot-from-2016-08-11-151947.png" alt="Screenshot from 2016-08-11 15:19:47" width="652" height="402" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Screenshot-from-2016-08-11-151947.png 652w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Screenshot-from-2016-08-11-151947-300x185.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 652px) 100vw, 652px" /></a>
<em>PhpStorm output for ‚ÄòFind Usages of WPPFM_FEED_P_LMTR‚Äô</em></p>

<p>The usage of this variable seems to be limited one occurrence here,</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">includes/application/class-feed-processor.php</code></p>

<p>It defines a variable on line:69,¬† and¬† there‚Äôs is a little cryptic arithmetic involved,</p>

<div class="language-php highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$grmln</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">9</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="p">(</span> <span class="mi">5</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="no">WPPFM_FEED_P_LMTR</span> <span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Remember when the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WPPFM_FEED_P_LMTR</code> constant was set it was 18, so <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$grmln = 99</code>.</p>

<p>Where is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$grmln</code> used?<figure id="attachment_369" style="max-width: 969px" class="wp-caption alignnone"></figure></p>

<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Screenshot-from-2016-08-11-152417.png"><img class="wp-image-369 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Screenshot-from-2016-08-11-152417.png" alt="Screenshot from 2016-08-11 15:24:17" width="969" height="354" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Screenshot-from-2016-08-11-152417.png 969w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Screenshot-from-2016-08-11-152417-300x110.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Screenshot-from-2016-08-11-152417-768x281.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 969px) 100vw, 969px" /></a>
<em>PhpStorm output for ‚ÄòFind Usages of $grmln‚Äô</em></p>

<p>On line:114 you‚Äôll see the conditional statement that implements the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$grmln</code> variable, which contains a break to the loop when the statement is true.</p>

<div class="language-php highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span> <span class="nf">get_option</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="s1">'wppfm_lic_status'</span> <span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">!==</span> <span class="s1">'valid'</span> <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="nv">$this</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="n">_product_counter</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="nv">$grmln</span> <span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="k">break</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Well that‚Äôs a problem, because the conditions to make this statement true are such, ‚Äúif the user doesn‚Äôt have a license status that‚Äôs valid‚Äù, and ‚Äúif the post count is over 99‚Äù.</p>

<p>All you really need to do is remove the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">break;</code>, and then as one would expect, the loop no longer breaks when the unlicensed user product limitation is reached. You could likely also remove this limit by bumping <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WPPFM_FEED_P_LMTR</code> to be equal to an absurdly high number or setting <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$grmln</code> equal to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">count($data)</code>‚Ä¶.maybe we could even define <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wppfm_lic_status</code> ourselves to be valid and just cruise on past this block as licensed users. Whatever‚Ä¶I didn‚Äôt explore these options or play around much in that regard, so other‚Äôs will have more information for me I‚Äôm sure. For those of you that wanted to know more behind how the tl;dr version of this post accomplished removing the limitation, now you do.</p>

<h2 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h2>

<p>Developers work long and hard on these plugins, and if you‚Äôre going to use features which extend beyond the free versions of plugins, it‚Äôs best you just buy them. Sometimes I‚Äôll publish interesting ways of extending functionality to the free version, but this is NO WHERE CLOSE to the benefits of actually obtaining the paid version. Updates will break these little hacks, and they may change functionality here and there in unexpected ways. Not to mention it‚Äôs always nice to get product support from the developer, which a license will get you, and hacking will not üôÇ</p>
