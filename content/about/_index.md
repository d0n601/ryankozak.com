Hello, I'm Ryan Kozak and I'm a security engineer and recovering web developer. I moved to Northern California in December of 2013, and with the exception of a brief few years living in Memphis, I spent most of my childhood on the Central Coast in a little town called [Santa Maria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Maria,_California) California.

This is my blog, and sometimes I'll post things. I don't want it to be too formal. If you'd like to talk to me you can send me an email via the little icon on my menu.

### More...

I'm an avid Linux user and an advocate for FOSS. Currently I work as an offensive security engineer for some tech comapny that you can see clearly listed on my LinkedIn (OSINT?). In times past I've worked in vulnerability management, and as a full stack developer mostly using PHP and frameworks like Laravel, CodeIgniter, and the dreaded WordPress CMS. 

As of 2021 I'm co-leading the [OWASP Sacramento chapter](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Sacramento), which has been a very rewarding/challenging experience.

When I'm not on a screen I love riding my motorcycles (Motocross and ADV), cooking, traveling, or getting out into the mountains locally. I'm always trying to remind myself that computers aren't actually real, and that there's a whole life out side of screens. That is why you won't find me blogging about things that aren't too computer related, it ties everything together too much to post everything I do.
