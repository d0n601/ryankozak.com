## Welcome
Hello, I'm Ryan Kozak and I'm an offensive security engineer. This is my blog, and sometimes I'll post things. I don't want it to be too formal. If you'd like to talk to me you can send me an email via the little icon on my menu.

### More...

I'm an avid Linux user and an advocate for FOSS. Currently I work for some tech comapny that you can see clearly listed on my LinkedIn. In times past I've worked in vulnerability management, threat intelligence, and as a full stack developer.

I moved to Northern California in December of 2013, and with the exception of a brief few years living in Memphis, I spent most of my childhood on the Central Coast of California in a little town called [Santa Maria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Maria,_California). From of 2021-2025 I was the co-lead [OWASP Sacramento chapter](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Sacramento), which was a very rewarding and challenging experience.

Outside of computers I love riding my motorcycles (Motocross and ADV), flying small airplanes, cooking, traveling, or getting out into the mountains.
