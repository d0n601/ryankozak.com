Although I&#8217;ve not actually been inside yet, I&#8217;m on the email list for the [Sacramento Hacker Lab](http://hackerlab.org). A few weeks ago they put out an email alerting local developers that their new location in Rocklin is hosting an event for Intel's [RealSense 3D camera technology](http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/realsense-overview.htm). It's not really my field but I love leaning new things, and I love any kind of conference, so I applied. A few weeks later I got called up by an event organizer and they were nice enough to grant me a spot.

Follow up  to come.

## Update
The event was very fun, and I cant thank them enough for the food and the presentation, oh and the camera ðŸ™‚

I was really impressed with the technology but a bit bummed that I needed Windows 8.1, and a bit bummed the Java Script support is the least developed. The folks who knew the Unity Engine seemed to be really going to town.
